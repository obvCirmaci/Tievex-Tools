# About the Tievex Upscaler..
-  The upscaler is a **fork** of *discord.gg/ctt*'s upscaler, mine simply has a modified ffmpeg script that prioritises quality at the expense of having larger file sizes.

-  **To install the Upscaler**, simply run the installer which u can download [here](https://github.com/9be243dd-ad62-40cc-b3a7-4813c8494d72) which will install Scoop, Ffmpeg (Added to Path) and the actual
upscaler.
